# Clean Code Chapter 2 Reflection

| Name and explenation | Reflection and Rules from Clean Code         
| ------------- |:-------------:|
| averageWordLength(text) - Function in TextAverage that calculates the average word length for the provided text      | averageWordLength is a clear and descriptive name, which make it easy to understand what the function is doing, it is an intention-revealing name (p. 18). It is a searchable name, as in, if someone wouldn't remember the name but know what the function was doing they could search either "avg" or "average" and they would be able to locate the function  (p. 22). It is a pronounceable name, so when talking to other developers the name can be pronounced and understood (p. 21). |
| countLetters(text)   - Function name in the TextCounter class that counts the number of letters    | This name is confusing because it is not inention-revealing (p. 18), it could mean 'How many letters are present?', 'How many times is X letter present', or 'How many letters are in word X' Confusing wording - do we mean how many Letters are present or Each letter? In this instance, every letter is counted once, but that is not clear from the function name and therefor it is bad naming. A better name would have been countTotalLettersInText as then the name would reveal the intention of the function .|
|   TextManipulator - Classname for one of the main classes in the module.    | This could be concidered a break of the Donâ€™t Be Cute rule (p. 26) as Manipulator per Google is "a person who controls or influences others in a clever or unscrupulous way.", which doesn't translate well to whay the function actually does. The code and functions in TextManipulator has two themes - replace and reverse text. A better solution could be to split this up in two seperate classes called TextReplacer and TextReverser. This would provide more clarity and be more aligned with Use Intention-Revealing Names (p. 18). |
|   letterFrequencyList - Variable name in the mostUsedLetters(text, topFive = 5) that check most used letters function in the TextFrequency class     | In the function a variable is named "letterFrequencyList" which is breaking the Avoid Disinformation (p. 19) rule which says that "Programmers must avoid leaving false clues that obscure the meaning of code". The variable name is breaking this because "letterFrequencyList" is not an actual List, and a List means something special to programmers. A better name could have been "letterFrequencyMap" to avoid giving false conclusions with the word List.  |
|     validateLength() - Function name in the TextInputValidator class that validates the length of the input   |  validateLength is a very generic name that can mean a lot of things. Improvement of context, for example, having the function placed in a well named class like TextInputValidator, brings a meaningful context to the funciton so it becomes clear what the function does in that context (p. 27-28)  |

## Reflection
The chapter is about providing meaningul names to variables, functions, classes and other aspects of the code. It also advise on what good naming is and what it is not. The importance of having thoughtful and good naming of the code is because it can provide a sort of "documentation" to what the code is about by being intention-revealing, which then makes it easier for the person reading it to understand and work with the code. I especially liked the part of the book about "Avoid Mental Mapping", as a junior developer, my idea of a senior developer would be someone that writes complicated code, code that is impossible to understand. However, this section of the book made me understand that writing complicating code that is difficult to understand is not a sign of superiority, and that developers should activly working on being understood. That good code is code that one and others can understand. What I would have liked for the author to also touch on the subject of how or if cultural backgrounds and cultural context can affect our naming and understanding. This is in the context that a lot of developers works remote today, and often they may be working with collegues in different countries. It would be intresting to learn more about if how to approach naming in a global context where not everyone has the same reference point.
